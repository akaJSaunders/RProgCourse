Factors
  - Used to represent categorical data
  - Labeled data
  - lm() , glm()
  - Using factors with labels is better than using integers
    because factors are self describing
  - "Male" and "Female" is better than 1 and 2

    > x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"))
    > table(x)
    > unclass(x)
    > x <- factor(c("yes", "yes", "no", "yes", "no"),
                  levels = c("yes", "no"))
