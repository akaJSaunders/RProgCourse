Binding Symbols

> lm <- function(x) (x * x)
> lm
function(x) (x*x)

how does it know what lm to call? (standard vs My own)

  1. Searches the global enviroment for a symbol name matching requested
  2. Searches namespace of each package on the search list

the search list can be found using the search function

the order of the packages on the search list matters!

users can config the order

R has different spaces for non function and function vectors
might not interfere

Scoping Rules

  -determine how a value is associated with a free variable in a function
  - Lexical scoping or static scoping. Alternative to dynamic
  - useful for simplifying statistical calculations
